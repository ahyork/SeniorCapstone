# Arthur York Senior Capstone 2020

This website contains all the information for Arthur York's Senior Capstone Research Project. This project is about developing and expanding [`PorousMaterials.jl`](https://github.com/SimonEnsemble/PorousMaterials.jl), a free and open source software package for `Julia` to run molecular simulations, specifically with gas adsorption inside nano-porous materials [1]. This codebase is being developed in conjunction with other undergraduates, graduate students, Dr. Cory Simon, and various open-source contributors.  

`Julia` is a free and open source language designed for scientific computing. It shares syntax with languages like `Matlab` and `Python`, but due to its just-in-time compiler is able to run code almost as fast as `C` [2]. This makes it ideal for an interdisciplinary project like this because it creates a low barrier of entry for people with little experience programming while still having excellent speed for high throughput computation. It is easier to write, develop, and review code because it isn't bogged down by cryptic syntax. Having a computer science background allows me to focus on high level algorithm design and optimization of `Julia` code.
